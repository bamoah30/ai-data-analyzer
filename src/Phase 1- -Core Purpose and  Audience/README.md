# Phase 1 – Core Purpose and Audience

This phase defines the strategic foundation of the **AI Data Analyzer** project. It clarifies the tool’s purpose, target audience, and minimum viable features—setting the tone for all future development.

---

## Core Purpose

**AI Data Analyzer** is a Python-based tool that uses the HuggingFace API and OpenAI API to automate exploratory data analysis (EDA) on CSV, Json, and Excel files.  
It’s designed to accelerate Bernard’s mastery of Python, API integration, and intelligent data workflows—while serving as a public proof-of-concept in his 24-month AI Engineering roadmap.

---

## Target Audience

This project is built for:

- **Recruiters** evaluating Bernard’s Python, API, and data engineering skills
- **AI learners** seeking a beginner-friendly template for EDA automation
- **Engineers** interested in modular, CLI-driven tools that integrate LLMs

Each audience segment reflects Bernard’s transformation from Mechanical Engineer to a fullstack AI + Robotics Engineer.

## MVP Features (Minimum Viable Product)

| Feature                 | Description                                                    |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CSV/Excel/JSON Upload   | Load and parse tabular or structured data from local files     |
| Prompt Template Builder | Generate structured prompts for HuggingFace API and OpenAI API |
| Insight Generation      | Use LLM to summarize trends, anomalies, and patterns           |
| CLI Interface           | Run analysis from terminal with arguments                      |
| Streamlit Interface     | Run analysis using stramlit GUI                                |

These features form the backbone of the tool and will be expanded in later phases.
