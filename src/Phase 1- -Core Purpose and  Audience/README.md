# 📘 Phase 1 – Core Purpose and Audience

This phase defines the strategic foundation of the **AI Data Analyzer** project. It clarifies the tool’s purpose, target audience, and minimum viable features—setting the tone for all future development.

---

## 🎯 Core Purpose

**AI Data Analyzer** is a Python-based tool that uses the OpenAI API to automate exploratory data analysis (EDA) on CSV/Json, and Excel files.  
It’s designed to accelerate Bernard’s mastery of Python, API integration, and intelligent data workflows—while serving as a public proof-of-concept in his 24-month AI Engineering roadmap.

---

## 👥 Target Audience

This project is built for:

- **Recruiters** evaluating Bernard’s Python, API, and data engineering skills
- **AI learners** seeking a beginner-friendly template for EDA automation
- **Engineers** interested in modular, CLI-driven tools that integrate LLMs

Each audience segment reflects Bernard’s transformation from Mechanical Engineer to Futuristic Unicorn Engineer.
